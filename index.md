I'm a graduating PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/){:target="_blank"}. My primary research interest is in principled machine learning methodologies (algorithm design). A major part of my PhD research focuses on gradient estimation techniques under various practical constraints. I've also worked on automated machine learning (AutoML) and more specifically meta-learning in grad school. 

In the past, I have
- worked as a Quantitative Research Intern in a machine learning team at [Cubist Systematic Strategies](https://point72.com/cubist/){:target="_blank"}.
- worked as a student researcher in the [Vizier](https://research.google/pubs/google-vizier-a-service-for-black-box-optimization/){:target="_blank"} team at Google DeepMind.
- interned with the [Custom Labels](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/){:target="_blank"} team in Amazon Web Services (Rekognition)
- interned with the Applied Machine Learning team (Bellevue, WA) at ByteDance. 

<!-- I have worked on areas including meta-learning, zeroth-order-gradient estimation, out-of-distribution generalization/evaluation, federated learning, privacy protection, and model interpretability. -->

Before my PhD, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with double majors in Math and Computer Science from Duke University where I worked with Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/){:target="_blank"} on interpretable deep learning.
