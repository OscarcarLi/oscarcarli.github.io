I'm a rising third year PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/){:target="_blank"}. I'm broadly interested in two aspects of machine learning:
1. how to endow machine learning models with more human-like intelligence;

2. how to make machine learning models more practically useful and reliable.

Towards these two goals, I've worked on areas including meta-learning, out-of-distribution generalization/evaluation, federated learning, privacy protection, and model interpretability.

Before starting my graduate studies, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science from Duke University where I worked with Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/){:target="_blank"}.
