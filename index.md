I'm a rising fifth year PhD student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Professor [Virginia Smith](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~smithv/){:target="_blank"}. My current research focuses on automated machine learning (AutoML) and more specifically meta-learning. I'm also a student researcher in the Vizier team at Google DeepMind.

In the past, I interned with the [Custom Labels](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) team in Amazon Web Services (Rekognition) and the Applied Machine Learning team (Bellevue, WA) at ByteDance. I have worked on areas including meta-learning, zeroth-order-gradient estimation, out-of-distribution generalization/evaluation, federated learning, privacy protection, and model interpretability.



Before my PhD, I graduated Summa Cum Laude with double majors in Math and Computer Science from Duke University where I worked with Professor [Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/){:target="_blank"}.
